            description: 'In 2012, the Red Hook Houses, a public housing complex in Red Hook, Brooklyn was severely hit by Hurricane Sandy. The sewer overflow and high tides inundated the home of 6,000 residents located on reclaimed land in close proximity to water. They suffered the impact for weeks as they were left without access to fresh water, the houses were molded from the leaks, putting the residentsâ€™ health at risk, and saltwater destroyed critical infrastructure, including boiler and electrical panels.',
