          <p class='story-text'> <i>Understanding the Morphologies of Informal Settlements in City of Kigali</i> is Final Project for Mapping Countermapping (CRP 5850 Fall 2022) authored by Juyeon Maeng.</p>
          <p class='story-text'>This mapping of informal settlement  is an effort to understand the morphology of the informal settlements in City of Kigali, Rwanda. </p>
  
          <h1 class="ui small header">Countermapping Informal Settlements</h1>
          <p class='story-text'>Informal settlements are underrepresented in official maps (Marinovic, 2022), neglected in urban morphologies studies (McCartney & Krishnamurthy, 2018), and sometimes deliberately kept invisible (Shatkin, 2004). In developing countries where the informal settlements are concentrated, some governments lack the technical capacity or resources, or some forbid the mapping or disclosing data on the informal population (Samper et al., 2020). Lack of precise data hinders city governments and scholars to bring about suitable intervention Recognizing, visualizing and classifying informal settlements are vital in securing tenure, catalyzing transformation (Samper et al., 2020). According to Marinovic (2022), the effort to map the less visible population in the society through studying the urban morphology of informal housings is described as counter-mapping. As counter-maps, the mapping of informal settlements evolution exposes omitted gaps in official maps and represents the spatial layout of marginalized. (Marinovic, 2022)</p>

          <p class='story-text'>Mapping the urban morphology enable us to understand the urban expansion and pattern, which can inform appropriate intervention. Upon literature review, I was not able to find a comprehensive study on urban morphology in informal settlement Kigali, Rwanda. This project is an attempt to understand the urban informal settlement morphology, inform the pattern and influencing factor to the informal settlement expansion. This study will also be counter-mapping effort to increase visibility to the informal settlements often omitted in official documents and mappings.</p>

          <h1 class="ui small header">Morphology Analytic Framework</h1>
          <p class='story-text'>Existing analytic pattern in morphologic studies included :  </p>
            <p class='story-text'>(1) interactions of people and their resultant building activities and land consumption within the formal land market, </p>
            <p class='story-text'>(2)hierarchical street and public space network, </p>
            <p class='story-text'>(3) legally land parcels, </p>
            <p class='story-text'>(4) topography of the site such as contours and water bodies, </p>
            <p class='story-text'>(5) existing and proposed land use and flows of inhabitants,</p> 
            <p class='story-text'>(6) Three-dimensional composition of the city’s built form, outlining built, and unbuilt areas (McCartney & Krishnamurthy, 2018) </p>

          <p class='story-text'>However, McCartney and Krishnamurthy (2018) argue that these are not appropriate for informal settlements studies and propose an alternative. I am borrowing my analytic framework from their proposal which included </p>
          <p class='story-text'>(1) Nonspatial social, economic, and political factors that have spatial impact</p> 
           <p class='story-text'>(2) Situational factors, </p>
        <p class='story-text'>(3) Site factors,</p>
         <p class='story-text'>(4) Circulation space configurations, </p>
        <p class='story-text'>and (5) Building typology. </p>
        <p class='story-text'>Among the five patterns, I am focusing on Situation factors and Site factors (See figure 1). Situation factors analyze the location of settlement and its connectivity to social and built infrastructure. Site factors examine informal settlement’s risk and priorities. </p>

          <p class='story-text'>In effort to customize the analytical framework to the the case study of Kigali, Site factors will be analyzed by using the information on the area of steep slopes, referring to slopes above 30%, and disaster risk prone land as flood-prone and/or landslide-prone land, as suggested by NLUDMP (MOE, 2020). The affordable land will refer to edge of the growth boundary and lacking access and connectivity, as described in McCartney and Krishnamurthy (2018). They explained that affordable lands can be found in either the edge of the urban boundary in a regularized urban growth models and clusters within the urban boundary. The informal settlements in affordable land lacks access to transport and social infrastructure that connects them to the urban fabric.</p>
